# Rational_Factors_Of_Polynomials
An allegorical demonstration of finding exact solutions - despite the oft-quoted Galois theory result - for polynomials of arbitrary order. The aim is to demonstrate, by comparison, the dangers of claiming a complexity-theoretic result implies some computation can't be done: there are often loopholes.
